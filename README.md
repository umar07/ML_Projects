# Machine Learning Projects

Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy. Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the capability to learn without being explicitly programmed. Currently, ML has been used in multiple fields and industries. For example, medical diagnosis, image processing, prediction, classification, learning association, regression etc.

This repository contains a list of projects made using Machine Learning.
