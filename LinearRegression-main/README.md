# LinearRegression

This repository contains basic examples single and multi-variable linear regression.
The programs uses sklearn library for linear model and train/test-split, pandas for tabular display in data-frames, and matplotlib.myplot for visualising the graphs.
The data-sets were very basic and small, requiring no data-preprocessing except in one case.

## About the projects-

1) Canada Income - Defines a linear model between year and avg. income and then predicts the same for a given year.
2) Student Scores - Defines a linear model between number of hours and marks scored, and then predicts the marks for given number of hours.
3) Hiring Salary - Defines a linear multivariate model between years of experience, test-score, interview score, and salary. It predicts what salary should be given to the particular employee.
